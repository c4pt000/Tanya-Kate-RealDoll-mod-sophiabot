# * broken as of current don't use to build on

template build design is garbage from too many variables inter mixing into disconnected logical meanings to an extent,
(too many chefs spoil the soup -< 
template -> x template -> x template -> z template -z

zzzxxzxzxzxzxzxzxxzxzxzxzxxzxzxzx

^^ end result of mixing too many different style templates

^
my opinion

templates needed to be seperate concepts and possibly allowable by end user to install as mods or expansionability


who ever OpenCOG project originally was
